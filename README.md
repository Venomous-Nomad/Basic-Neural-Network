Basic Neural Network

This is a very quick and small project that people can copy and use to get to know neural networks in programming more.

inputs and outputs used:
0, 0, 1 = 0
1, 1, 1 = 1
1, 0, 1 = 1
0, 0, 1 = 0

I'm sure that you can identify the trend of the first number being the output of that row.
