This is a 3 layer, 2 synapse neural network that predicts the type of biome from environmental factors.

<b>To use, run BiomeNetworkv3.py<b>

I may add more biomes and factors, but for another day.

Simply enter the quantity/probability of the factor ranging from 0 to 1 in decimal. (e.g 0.35)
The neural network will then predict what biome you are currently describing.
